        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Chocolate chip cookies are classic drop cookies made from a buttery, vanilla-scented dough studded with chocolate chips. When baked, they spread into golden rounds with lightly crisp edges and a soft, chewy center (or a more crisp snap if baked longer).</p>
        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The most notable chocolate chip cookie recipe was invented by American chef Ruth Graves Wakefield in 1938.She invented the recipe during the period when she owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts. In this era, the Toll House Inn was a popular restaurant that featured home cooking. A myth holds that she accidentally developed the cookie, and that she expected the chocolate chunks would melt, making chocolate cookies. That is not the case; Wakefield stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, "We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie."She added chopped up bits from a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar into a cookie.The original recipe in Toll House Tried and True Recipes is called "Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookies". Wakefield gave Nestle the recipe for her cookies and was paid with a lifetime supply of chocolate from the company.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>These are the kitchen staples you'll need to make the best chocolate chip cookies of your life</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
            <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
            <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li>Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
            <li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
            <li>Nuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li>
        </ul>
